      <description>The Story Pirates meet a magical hermit crab (Santino Fontana) who either doesn’t believe in himself or isn’t actually magical, but that doesn’t stop the gang from making lots of wishes! Today's episode features two new stories: "In the Car," a bonkers, deliciously-autotuned pop explosion about the wonders you behold from inside your ride by 5 year old Leah from Maryland and "The Girl Who Couldn't Stop Reading - AKA Me!," a semi-autobiographical tale of a ambitious girl who won’t let the world stop her from reading every book ever written, by a 4th grader from Arizona named Lila.
